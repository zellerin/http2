  appropriate parsing functions, and writes collected responses,
- @FRAME-PARSERS, that parses the frame header and payload octets, and calls respective callbacks,
- @CALLBACKS that implement application specific behaviour,
- @FRAME-WRITERS such as WRITE-DATA-FRAME that are typically invoked from the callbacks,
- @ERRORS that break the loop as needed.
