  """
For example, this is how you can make a client that download several pages from
same source.

First, you need a custom request class, both to have something to specialize
FETCH-RESOURCE on and to keep the list of resources to fetch.

```
(defclass multi-url-request (simple-request)
  ((urls :accessor get-urls :initarg :urls)))

(defmethod fetch-resource ((connection client-http2-connection)
                           (request multi-url-request) args)

  (dolist (r (get-urls request))
    (fetch-resource connection r nil)))
```

Then you need a specialized stream class to specialize what to do when the
responses arrive. Here it prints out the response body for simplicity, and ends
if it got the last response.

```
(defclass my-client-stream (vanilla-client-stream)
  ())

(defmethod peer-ends-http-stream ((stream my-client-stream))
  (print (or (get-body stream) (http-stream-to-string stream)))
  (when (null (get-streams (get-connection stream)))
    (signal 'client-done))
  (terpri))
```

See GET-BODY,  HTTP-STREAM-TO-STRING and CLIENT-DONE.

And finally, you need to pass these as the call parameter:

```
(http2/client:retrieve-url "https://localhost:8088/body"
   :request-class 'multi-url-request
   :urls '("https://localhost:8088/body" "https://localhost:8088/")
   :stream-class 'my-client-stream)
```
