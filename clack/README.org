* Clack support

Rudimentary clack support should be working. Demo from clack readme is working
after some preparations:
** Preparation
#+begin_src lisp :results none
  (ql:quickload :http2/server)
  (load
   (merge-pathnames  "clack/http2.lisp"
                     (asdf:system-source-directory (asdf:find-system :http2))))
  (uiop:run-program
   "openssl req -new -nodes -x509 -days 365 -subj /CN=localhost -keyout /tmp/server.key -outform PEM -out /tmp/server.crt")
#+end_src

** Running clack demo
#+begin_src lisp :results none
  (defparameter *handler*
      (clack:clackup
        (lambda (env)
          (declare (ignore env))
          '(200 (:content-type "text/plain") ("Hello, Clack! Here we go!")))
    :server :http2
    :port 5050))
#+end_src

** Some considerations

:END:
- No websockets fot http/2. This is why Clog would not run out of the box.
- http/2 over plain unencrypted protocol is in general not supported, so a
  certificate are needed. The preparation above generates disposable self-signed
  certificate for testing. For non-localhost deployment you would get proper
  certificate, [[https://letsencrypt.org/docs/certificates-for-localhost/][for localhost it might be tricky]].
