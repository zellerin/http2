* Clack support

Rudimentary clack support should be working. Demo from clack readme is working
after some preparations:

** Running clack demo
#+begin_src lisp :results none
  (defparameter *handler*
      (clack:clackup
        (lambda (env)
          (declare (ignore env))
          '(200 (:content-type "text/plain") ("Hello, Clack! Here we go!")))
    :server :http2
    :port 5050))
#+end_src

** Some considerations

:END:
- No websockets fot http/2. This is why Clog would not run out of the box.
- http/2 over plain unencrypted protocol is in general not supported, so a
  certificate are needed. The server creates a self-signed one, but for a non-localhost deployment you should get proper
  certificate.
